# Long-term effects of climate and competition on forbs that vary in functional strategy

## About
Precipitation is projected to become both drier and more variable in many parts of the world, including California. While many species are adapted to variable climates, interactions with invasive species can undermine these adaptations, leading to shifts in community composition and with the potential for extinction in the long term. California annual grasslands are a unique community where invasive annual grasses dominate in biomass, but the majority of species diversity comes from the native forb community. Recent work suggests that species with resource acquisitive strategies are not only suffering from drier winters, but competition with invasive annual grasses is fueling their declines through increased mortality and lower seed set. This project seeks to understand which types of species (resource acquisitive vs resource conservative) are more susceptible to the long term interactive effects of invasive grass competition and future climate variability by parameterizing a stochastic growth model with field-based demographic data to simulate the combined long term effects of increased variability and competition. I will use numerical techniques to calculate the conditions under which each species persists or goes extinct.

## Questions
1. Under what probability of future wet/dry years species with resource acquisitive traits go extinct?
2. Under what probability of future wet/dry years species with resource conservative traits go extinct?
3. How does competition with grasses alter the expected time to extinction for each of these species?


## Methods

See [LaForgia et al. 2019 (preprint)](https://ecoevorxiv.org/hqwk4/) for details on experimental set up, demographic data collection, assessment of plant functional strategies, and calculation of lambda (per capita population growth rate)

### Model Parameterization
TBD
